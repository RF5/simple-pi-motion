# simple-pi-motion
Raspberry Pi with camera V2 used as a motion detecting camera with Telegram notification. See [my post explaining its use, installation and customization here](https://rf5.github.io/2019/01/20/raspberry-pi-3B-motion-detection.html).

This is inspired by the [picamera documentation on motion analysis](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.10/api_array.html) and [Pimotion](https://github.com/citrusbyte/pimotion). Thanks!
